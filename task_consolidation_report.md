## Consolidation Approach

1. **Tasks with Identical Descriptions**: Kept one task and deleted the rest
2. **Tasks with Non-Informative Descriptions**: Deleted these tasks
3. **Tasks with Rich Descriptions**: Renamed to differentiate based on content
4. **Tasks with Basic Descriptions**: Consolidated by initiative, keeping one task per initiative
5. **Parent-Child Relationships**: Preserved by updating ParentTaskID references
