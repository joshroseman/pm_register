# Initiative Summary: FP&A Platform Selection & Implementation

## Overview

This initiative addresses the recognized need to move beyond existing tools like Coda and Asana for robust financial modeling, planning, and analysis. The goal is to select and implement a dedicated Financial Planning & Analysis (FP&A) platform to support strategic decision-making, budgeting, forecasting, and managing capital investments across the Loove ecosystem.

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

*   **Needs Assessment and Requirements Definition:**
    *   Clearly define the specific financial modeling, reporting, and analytical capabilities required by the Loove ecosystem.
    *   Consider the needs of various verticals (Caf√©, Retail, Venue, Studio Services) and the overall organization, including the non-profit arm.
    *   Identify key stakeholders who will use or rely on the FP&A system (Josh, Malcolm, potentially Sarah, future finance hires).
*   **Platform Research and Selection:**
    *   Research available FP&A software solutions suitable for a small to medium-sized organization with diverse revenue streams and complex projects.
    *   Evaluate platforms based on features, scalability, ease of use, integration capabilities (e.g., with accounting software), and cost.
    *   Conduct demos and trials of shortlisted platforms.
    *   Make a final selection decision.
*   **Implementation Planning and Execution:**
    *   Develop a detailed implementation plan, including data migration, system configuration, user training, and go-live strategy.
    *   Migrate historical financial data from existing systems (QuickBooks, Coda, Asana, spreadsheets) as needed.
    *   Configure the FP&A platform to align with the Loove ecosystem's chart of accounts, reporting structures, and key performance indicators (KPIs).
    *   Develop standard report templates and dashboards.
*   **User Training and Adoption:**
    *   Provide comprehensive training to all users of the FP&A platform.
    *   Establish processes for ongoing data input, maintenance, and report generation.
    *   Encourage adoption and utilization of the platform for financial decision-making.

## Dependencies

*   Clear understanding of the organization's financial data and reporting needs.
*   Availability of Josh and other key stakeholders for requirements gathering and platform evaluation.
*   Budget for purchasing and implementing the FP&A software.
*   Cooperation from accounting personnel (Malcolm) for data migration and system integration.
*   Resolution of foundational corporate governance and tax issues to ensure accurate financial data inputs.

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary decision-maker, key user for strategic planning)
*   Malcolm (Accountant, likely involved in data migration and ongoing use)
*   Sarah (If still involved in finance, may have input or use the system)
*   Future finance director/CFO (if hired)

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   Recognized as a critical path element for Phase 2 (Operational Buildout).
*   The need to move beyond current tools for financial modeling is explicitly stated.
*   No specific platform has been selected yet.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Formally document the requirements for the FP&A platform.
2.  Begin researching and shortlisting potential FP&A software solutions.
3.  Schedule demos and trials with vendors.
4.  Make a platform selection and secure the budget for it.
5.  Develop a detailed implementation project plan.
6.  Execute the implementation, including data migration and configuration.
7.  Train users and integrate the platform into regular financial management processes.
