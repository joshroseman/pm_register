# Initiative Summary: Urgent Facility Repairs (North 6th & Studio 2R)

## Overview

This initiative focuses on addressing immediate and critical facility issues at both the North 6th Street venue and the Studio 2R space. The primary goal is to stabilize the physical environments, ensure safety, and make the spaces functional for ongoing and future operations. These repairs are often prerequisites for other activities and initiatives.

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

### North 6th Street Venue

*   **Building Envelope & Structural Integrity:**
    *   Addressing water infiltration issues (e.g., stucco repair, potential roof issues).
    *   Ensuring overall structural soundness.
*   **Critical Systems Repair/Upgrade:**
    *   **Electrical System:**
        *   Installation of new balanced power transformer.
        *   Clear delineation of voltage arrays per circuit.
        *   Assessment of existing modular balanced power transformers (potential move to North 12th).
    *   **HVAC System:** Ensuring functionality and addressing any immediate repair needs.
    *   **Plumbing:** Addressing any urgent leaks or blockages.
*   **Operational Readiness:**
    *   **Console Maintenance:** Critical for re-engaging with the space and supporting venue operations.
    *   **Speaker Protection:** Installation of protective posts for Cornwall speakers.
    *   **Microphone & Cable Maintenance/Procurement:** Repairing existing microphones (e.g., Microtech Gefell), testing others (Royer Labs ribbon, Schoeps condensers), and purchasing necessary cables (XLRs) and mounting equipment (for Wonder CM7).

### Studio 2R

*   **Building Envelope & Structural Integrity:**
    *   Addressing any immediate structural or weatherproofing concerns.
*   **Critical Systems Repair/Upgrade:**
    *   Ensuring functional electrical, HVAC, and plumbing systems.
*   **Operational Readiness (Pre-Rehab):**
    *   Initial cleanup and assessment for the larger rehabilitation project.
    *   Securing the space.

## Dependencies

*   Availability of Lou and his team (Dylon, Cline) for execution.
*   Budget allocation for materials and labor.
*   Access to spaces, potentially requiring coordination with tenants or other stakeholders.
*   For electrical work, clear plans and potentially permits.

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary oversight and decision-maker)
*   Lou (Primary executor for repairs and maintenance)
*   Potentially Srinija (as partner in LLCs owning/leasing spaces)

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   Many tasks are identified as urgent or overdue.
*   Some work is stalled (e.g., tube maintenance at North 12th, which is related but not directly North 6th/2R urgent repairs).
*   Balanced power transformer for North 6th is about to be installed.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Prioritize the most critical safety and operational repairs.
2.  Secure necessary quotes and schedule work with Lou.
3.  Track progress within the Loove Brain / MTAP system.
4.  Ensure repairs align with longer-term plans for space utilization (e.g., Caf√© launch, Studio 2R rehab).
