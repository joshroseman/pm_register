# Initiative Summary: Loove Brain - Basic Integrations & External Views

## Overview

This initiative focuses on enhancing the functionality and accessibility of the Loove Brain / MTAP system by exploring and implementing basic integrations with other tools (Asana, Coda) and methods for creating external views of the program management data. The goal is to move beyond the RASA PM thread as the sole repository and enable broader team visibility and interaction with the structured information.

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

*   **Research and Evaluation of Integration Tools/Methods:**
    *   **GPT UI Scraping (Axiom):** Exploring tools like Axiom.ai to scrape data directly from the GPT user interface where the RASA PM thread resides. This is considered a potential workaround if direct API access is problematic or delayed.
    *   **API-based Workflows (N8N, Zapier, etc.):** Investigating workflow automation platforms like N8N or Zapier to connect RASA/GPT (if an API is used) with Asana, Coda, or other target systems.
    *   **Custom Scripting/Development:** Considering the development of custom scripts (e.g., Python) for more tailored integrations if off-the-shelf tools are insufficient.
    *   **Manus Browser Extension:** Leveraging the previously scoped Manus browser extension for scraping GPT UI, if applicable and feasible.
*   **Proof-of-Concept Implementations:**
    *   Conducting small-scale tests or proofs-of-concept for the most promising integration methods.
    *   Focusing initially on one-way data flows (e.g., from RASA PM thread to Asana/Coda) to populate external systems with tasks and project information.
*   **Defining Data Mapping and Synchronization Logic:**
    *   Specifying how data elements from the MTAP (Initiatives, Projects, Tasks, Verticals, Status, etc.) will map to fields in Asana, Coda, or other external views.
    *   Determining the frequency and method of data synchronization (manual, scheduled, event-triggered).
*   **Creating External Views/Dashboards:**
    *   Designing and implementing initial dashboards or summary views in Coda or other platforms that pull data from the Loove Brain.
    *   Focusing on views that provide high-level overviews for stakeholders or specific cuts of data for team members.

## Dependencies

*   A sufficiently structured and populated Multidimensional Program Register (MTAP-MPM_01) within the RASA PM thread to serve as the source of truth.
*   Decisions on whether to pursue API access for GPT or rely on UI scraping methods in the short term.
*   Availability of technical resources (Josh, potentially Manus, or external help) to set up and configure integration tools or develop custom scripts.
*   Clear understanding of the data requirements for external views (what information needs to be seen by whom).

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary driver, will use external views and benefit from integrations)
*   RASA (Source of the structured data)
*   Manus (Potential developer of integration solutions or browser extension)
*   Team members who will consume information from external views (e.g., Lou, Christine, for task lists or project updates in Asana/Coda).

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   Identified as a critical path element for Phase 2 (Operational Buildout).
*   Tools like Axiom and N8N have been mentioned as possibilities.
*   The Manus browser extension for scraping has been previously scoped.
*   The primary goal is to make the PM data more accessible beyond the direct RASA/GPT interface.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Prioritize the most critical external views needed (e.g., high-level initiative status, key project timelines).
2.  Conduct a focused evaluation of 1-2 promising integration tools/methods (e.g., Axiom for UI scraping, N8N for potential future API use).
3.  Implement a proof-of-concept for one key data flow (e.g., extracting tasks for a specific project into a Coda table or Asana project).
4.  Based on the PoC, refine the data mapping and synchronization strategy.
5.  Gradually roll out additional integrations and external views as the Loove Brain data matures.
