# Initiative Summary: Café Launch

## Overview

This initiative focuses on the planning, preparation, and launch of the Café, a key revenue-generating vertical and community touchpoint within the Loove ecosystem. It involves ensuring compliance, setting up operations, staffing, and defining the Café's offerings and ambiance.

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

*   **Compliance and Permitting:**
    *   Addressing facility compliance issues (e.g., ceiling, floors, based on Asana CSV for Lou to bid on).
    *   Securing all necessary permits and certificates for food service operation (e.g., Department of Health).
    *   Ensuring at least one staff member (potentially Christine) obtains a Food Handler's Certificate.
*   **Physical Space Readiness:**
    *   Completing any required minor renovations or fit-out for the Café space.
    *   Ensuring all equipment (espresso machine, grinders, refrigeration, POS system) is operational.
    *   Addressing issues like the noisy refrigerator in the gallery if it impacts the Café area.
    *   Integrating art and design elements (e.g., Christine's murals, Ayane's art) to create the desired ambiance.
*   **Operational Setup:**
    *   **Menu Development:** Defining the Café's menu (coffee, tea, pastries, other offerings).
    *   **Supplier Agreements:** Establishing relationships and agreements with vendors for coffee beans, milk, pastries (e.g., Emmanuel as potential pastry vendor/consultant), and other supplies.
    *   **Inventory Management:** Setting up initial inventory and processes for ongoing management.
    *   **POS System:** Ensuring the Point of Sale system is configured and staff are trained.
    *   **Defining Standards:** Establishing operational standards for quality, service, and cleanliness.
*   **Staffing and Management:**
    *   **Bootstrapping Management:** Josh and Christine to potentially bootstrap Café management initially.
    *   **Hiring Baristas/Staff:** Recruiting and training staff for daily operations.
    *   Identifying and securing a dedicated Café Manager (longer-term goal if not achieved for launch).

## Dependencies

*   Completion of urgent facility repairs and compliance work in the Café area.
*   Availability of funds for equipment, supplies, and initial staffing.
*   Successful procurement of permits and licenses.
*   Josh's and Christine's availability for bootstrapping management and setup.
*   Establishing reliable supplier relationships.

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary driver, involved in all aspects of planning and bootstrapping)
*   Christine (Key role in bootstrapping, design, potentially Food Handler's Cert.)
*   Lou (For facility compliance work)
*   Emmanuel (Potential pastry vendor/consultant)
*   Future Café manager and staff
*   Customers

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   Identified as a critical path element for Phase 2 (Operational Buildout).
*   Compliance tasks (ceiling, floors) have been identified and are pending action by Lou.
*   Christine is noted as a key person for bootstrapping.
*   Discussions around pastry provision (Emmanuel) have occurred.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Prioritize and complete all facility compliance work required for permits.
2.  Aggressively pursue all necessary permits and licenses.
3.  Finalize initial menu and secure all supplier agreements.
4.  Recruit and train initial barista staff if Christine and Josh are not covering all shifts.
5.  Complete physical setup and equipment checks.
6.  Plan and execute a soft launch, followed by a full launch.
7.  Establish clear financial tracking and performance metrics for the Café from day one.
