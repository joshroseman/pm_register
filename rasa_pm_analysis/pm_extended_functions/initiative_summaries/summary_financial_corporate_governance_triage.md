# Initiative Summary: Financial & Corporate Governance Triage

## Overview

This initiative addresses urgent and foundational issues related to the financial health and legal/corporate structure of the Loove ecosystem. Resolving these items is critical for operational stability, enabling fundraising, ensuring compliance, and clarifying ownership and liability across the various entities involved (LLCs, potential S-Corp, future Non-Profit).

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

*   **Corporate Structure Clarification and Rehabilitation:**
    *   **S-Corp Status:** Address the "broken" S-Corp status, including potential rehabilitation or dissolution and re-formation. This involves understanding tax implications and making strategic decisions about the best corporate structure for specific activities.
    *   **LLC Structures:** Clarify the roles and relationships of various LLCs (e.g., the one holding the North 12th lease with Srinija, the one for the Caf√©, the one for the overall business).
    *   **Inter-Company Agreements:** Potentially establish clear agreements for services or asset sharing between different legal entities within the Loove ecosystem.
*   **Tax Compliance and Resolution:**
    *   Addressing urgent tax liabilities and ensuring all entities are in good standing.
    *   Filing any overdue returns and establishing processes for timely future filings.
*   **Financial System Foundations:**
    *   **FP&A Platform Selection & Implementation:** Recognizing the limitations of Coda/Asana for robust financial modeling, selecting and implementing a dedicated FP&A (Financial Planning & Analysis) platform is a key task. This is crucial for strategic planning, budgeting, forecasting, and managing capital investments.
    *   **Bank Account Management:** Ensuring clear and separate bank accounts for different entities or major verticals as needed.
    *   **Chart of Accounts Review:** Potentially refining the chart of accounts to support better financial reporting and analysis through the new FP&A system.
*   **Legal and Governance Documentation:**
    *   Ensuring all corporate records (meeting minutes, resolutions, ownership agreements) are up to date and accurately reflect the current situation.
    *   Reviewing and updating lease agreements and other significant contracts.

## Dependencies

*   Access to all relevant financial records, corporate documents, and tax filings.
*   Input from legal and accounting professionals (e.g., discussions with accountant Malcolm, potential need for specialized legal counsel).
*   Decisions from Josh and potentially Srinija regarding corporate structuring choices.
*   Completion of research into FP&A platform options.

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary decision-maker and driver of this initiative)
*   Srinija (Partner, involved in LLC structures)
*   Malcolm (Accountant, providing current financial data and potentially advice)
*   External legal and tax advisors (as needed)

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   S-Corp issues are identified as a significant problem requiring immediate attention.
*   The need for a dedicated FP&A platform is recognized.
*   Discussions about LLC structures and their interplay are ongoing.
*   Urgent tax liabilities are a concern.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Engage legal/tax professionals to get definitive advice on S-Corp rehabilitation/dissolution and overall optimal corporate structuring.
2.  Gather all necessary documentation for tax resolution and corporate cleanup.
3.  Systematically research and select an appropriate FP&A platform.
4.  Develop a plan for implementing the chosen FP&A system and migrating relevant financial data.
5.  Make and document clear decisions about the structure and governance of each legal entity.
