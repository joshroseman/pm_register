# Initiative Summary: Key Personnel Decisions & Stability

## Overview

This initiative addresses the critical need to stabilize the existing team, address staffing gaps, clarify roles, and make strategic decisions about personnel to ensure the Loove ecosystem has the human resources required for its ambitious agenda. It involves both immediate actions for current team members and longer-term recruiting strategies.

## Key Projects and Tasks (Derived from RASA PM Thread & Roadmap Analysis)

*   **Stabilizing Existing Key Roles:**
    *   **Lou (Facilities & Maintenance):**
        *   Address contract restructuring: Transition Lou from a contractor to an employee, including defining salary, benefits, and formalizing his role and responsibilities. This is noted as a pending task for Josh.
        *   Ensure Lou has the support and resources needed for ongoing and upcoming facility work.
    *   **Christine (Art & Design, Café Support):**
        *   Clarify and support her role in bootstrapping the Café, including obtaining a Food Handler's Certificate.
        *   Ensure her art and design contributions are properly integrated and valued.
    *   **Max (Retail):**
        *   Address inconsistent availability due to health issues.
        *   Assess the need for additional retail support (e.g., Nick).
        *   Provide clear direction and support for managing gear sales via online platforms (Shopify/eBay/Reverb).
    *   **Abu Bokar Kone (Porter):**
        *   Provide culturally sensitive guidance and support for his duties, especially high-touch areas like plant care.
*   **Addressing Staffing Gaps & Role Clarification:**
    *   **Café Management:** Identify and secure a dedicated Café manager or formalize Christine's and Josh's roles in bootstrapping operations until a manager is found.
    *   **Retail Staffing:** Onboard Nick or other sales associates to ensure consistent retail coverage.
    *   **Finance Roles (Sarah & Malcolm):**
        *   Evaluate Sarah's shifted focus to finance and its adequacy.
        *   Assess Malcolm's role: Determine if he is being underutilized as a bookkeeper given his MBA and festival programming background, or if a higher-powered finance person is needed. Consider a potential shift in his role.
    *   **PR/Promotions:** Address the gap left by John Seroff's unsuccessful engagement for the booking program. Develop a new promotional strategy and identify a reliable PR person/resource.
*   **Developing a Proactive and Aligned Recruiting Strategy:**
    *   **Deconstructive Discussion (Josh & RASA):** Analyze past recruiting failures and current needs.
    *   **Moving Beyond Reactive Hiring:** Shift from relying on Sarah's network (now limited) and walk-ins.
    *   **Re-evaluating Traditional Platforms:** Acknowledge the user's dissatisfaction with platforms like AngelList and Indeed.com due to attracting misaligned candidates.
    *   **Exploring Direct and Personal Recruiting:** Consider strategies like Josh making personal appeals, potentially using social media, to attract mission-aligned individuals.
    *   **Maintaining a Current Log of Workers/Assignees/Resources:** Ensure RASA (and by extension, the Loove Brain) has an up-to-date list of all team members, contractors, and their capabilities.

## Dependencies

*   Josh's availability for direct conversations, decision-making, and personal recruiting efforts.
*   Budget for salaries, benefits (if Lou becomes an employee), and potential recruiting expenses.
*   Clarity on the strategic direction of various verticals to inform staffing needs.
*   Openness of current team members to discuss role changes or new responsibilities.

## Stakeholders

*   Josh (Primary decision-maker, directly involved in recruiting and role definitions)
*   All current team members (Lou, Christine, Max, Abu, Sarah, Malcolm)
*   Potential new hires
*   RASA (as a sounding board for strategy and keeper of personnel information)

## Status (as of dialogue in thread)

*   Several personnel issues are active concerns (Lou's contract, Max's availability, finance roles).
*   The need for a new recruiting strategy is clearly identified.
*   A list of current personnel and their general roles has been provided to RASA.

## Next Steps (Conceptual)

1.  Prioritize the discussion and resolution of Lou's contract status.
2.  Make immediate decisions regarding Café staffing to support the launch.
3.  Conduct a review of finance roles (Sarah/Malcolm) to optimize and address any gaps.
4.  Develop and begin implementing the new, more direct recruiting strategy.
5.  Ensure all personnel changes and role definitions are updated within the Loove Brain / MTAP system.
