# ⚠️ Status: High quality, but needs refinement in a few areas

| Area | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Descriptions (Tasks 001--150) | 90--95% complete | Some batch descriptions are brief or functional and could benefit from symbolic narrative or user-specific cues |
| Assignment Field | Mixed | Most tasks assigned to Josh; Lou, Christine, Max tagged where known---but some areas (e.g., Partner Sync, Budgeting) could benefit from explicit delegation or bundling |
| Category Logic (Tags) | Inconsistent | Strong use of initiative and tags overall, but some categories could be enriched (e.g., risk, milestone, deliverable, recurrent) |
| Task Timing Precision | Solid | Most tasks assigned start and due dates, but could benefit from repeat, seasonal, or fixed-date tags for rhythm bundling |
