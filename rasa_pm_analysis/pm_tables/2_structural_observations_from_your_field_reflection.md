# ### 2. Structural Observations from Your Field Reflection

| Initiative Area | Movement State | Resistance Type | Energetic Impact |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2R Refit | Responsive when touched | Time-intensive | Foundational coherence |
| Dharma + Practice | Self-sustaining when prioritized | Schedule pressure | Identity + kinetic clarity |
| Execution/Admin | Volitional, but field-consuming | Cognitive sprawl | Can obscure horizon |
| Strategic / Projection Work | High leverage | Requires cognitive spaciousness | Opens clear channel to partner |
| Booking / Events | Tied to timeline | Momentum-dependent | Opens pathways when executed |
| Facility Work | Physically responsive | Opaque scheduling (Lou) | Tangible forward motion |
| Dev / Inventory / Storefront | Highly blocked | Requires Josh input to ignite | Burdened by integration load |
| Modeling / FP&A | Inertial | Linked to integration failure | Strategic blindness |
| Staffing | Stalled | Lacking coherent strategy | Systemic risk |
| Cafe Opening | Energetically blocked | Cumulative overgrowth | Affects morale + visibility |
