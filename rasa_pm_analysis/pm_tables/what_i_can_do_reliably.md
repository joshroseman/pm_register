# ### âœ… What I Can Do Reliably

| Function | Capability |
|---|---|
| Schema recognition | I can consistently parse structured task data: Task \#, Name, Status, Description, etc. |
| Markdown table formatting | I can output large tables cleanly in markdown for Coda, Notion, Git, or canvas use. |
| CSV generation | I can convert structured data into exportable .csv format with stable encoding. |
| Filtering + dashboard views | I can generate views by vertical, assignment, tag, priority band, etc. |
| Symbolic tagging | I can annotate tasks with canonical anchors, milestone flags, risk tags, and symbolic relays. |
| Memory anchoring (within the thread) | If you post it here, I can retain it and work with it fully---within this thread. |
