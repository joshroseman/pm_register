# These forms of resistance are not about laziness, capacity, or failure---they are patterned by symbolic burden, karmic residue, and field memory.

| Initiative | Movement State | Form of Resistance | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| 2R Refit | Responsive but burdened | Symbolic overgrowth | Console represents past field, feels immovable; repairs echo psychic weathering |
| Dharma Practice | Clarity when engaged | Vastness / karmic accumulation | Feels too big to approach incrementally; carries responsibility for past healing |
| Execution/Admin | Daily engagement | Field saturation | Operational clarity, but can dominate visual field, masking other dimensions |
| Facility Work (Lou) | Moves when touched | Scheduling entropy | Work is visible; progress satisfying; problem is rhythm, not will |
| Staffing | Stalled | Identity + karmic distortion | Strategy viable but difficult to activate due to past frictions and resonance bleed |
| Modeling (FP&A) | Blocked | Integration drag | Blocked not by logic but by flow failure and unclear point of activation |
| Retail/Inventory | Heavily stalled | Inertia + complexity | High Josh-intensity; unclear starting mechanism; toolchain not yet unified |
| Cafe Opening | Symbolically loaded | Cumulative fog | Encodes past disappointments; timeline unclear; clarity diffused |
| Booking | Unlocks field when live | Momentum-based | Needs slow-gathered rhythm to activate; can't be forced; time-tied |
| Strategic Sync w/ Partner | High leverage | Mutual field occlusion | Without clear planning rhythm, vision collapses inward |
| SEO / Identity Management | Not yet tracked | Karmic residue | Past conflict visible online; affects recruiting and fundraising trust curve |
